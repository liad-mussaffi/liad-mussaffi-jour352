                For almost fifty years, they carried the bags of golf legends but also masterminded victories from the tees to the holes. Then, with one decision, their lives shifted, and the legacy of their glory days went unheralded. Finally, that’s changing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a small cardroom at the back of a municipal golf course clubhouse in Augusta, Georgia, a handful of old men gather and reminisce. Do you remember when…? How about that time…? What about when Willie Peterson wound up on the cover of Sports Illustrated back in seventy-two? Wasn’t that something? All prompts, meant to bring back sweet memories. As they deal cards, the men talk about their golf games and trade good-natured jabs. They have known one another for more than sixty years, gave one another their nicknames.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jim “Big Boy” Dent. Robert “Cigarette” Jones. Tommy “Burnt Biscuits” Bennett. Ike “Stabber” Choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                As long as ailments don’t keep them confined to the house, they can be found here a couple of days a week, playing bid whist, ribbing one another, and recalling the days when they were part of Augusta National Golf Club’s **all-Black caddie corps**, which players were required to use during the annual spring Masters Tournament. From the competition’s inception in 1934, the caddies—born of Augusta and attuned to the land—could be a golfer’s secret weapon coming around Amen Corner or for surviving other notoriously tricky holes like No. 4, Flowering Crab Apple, or No. 10, Camellia.
            </p>
            <p>
                These men were no beasts of burden, but talented prognosticators who turned a racist policy, rooted in subjugation, into a livelihood and a source of esteem—one that, ironically, first added diversity to the game of golf. Men like Willie Peterson, who was on the bag for five of Jack Nicklaus’s six Masters victories. Or Willie “Cemetery” Perteet, President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s personal caddie at Augusta National during the fifties. When the club bent to pressure in 1982 and dropped the ban on outside caddies, the change rocked the corps—many of its members, including those who counted on that crucial tournament paycheck to tide them over till the seasonal club reopened in October, had to look for other work.
            </p>

            <h2>A Deep Knowledge of the Land and its Secrets</h2>

            <p>
                In the four decades since, recognition for the pivotal part these men played in the game, until recently, scarcely existed. Even today, they aren’t heralded in the Augusta Museum of History, or mentioned in any of the historical milestones or records on the Masters’ website. But as their numbers dwindle—of the **seventy-six caddies enlisted in 1982, only twenty or so are still living**—they’re at long last beginning to be honored as what many of yesteryear’s golfers always knew them to be: the Pride of Augusta. An elite group of men who changed the game forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                For thousands of years, the Savannah River’s overflowing waters dumped sand, silt, and detritus onto what would one day become Augusta, leaving fertile soil in their wake. By 1858, three hundred or so particularly arable acres landed in the hands of Louis Mathieu Edouard Berckmans and his son Prosper Jules Alphonse, Belgian immigrants and horticulturists... More than seventy years later, in 1931, the Georgia-born golf champion Bobby Jones and his partner, Clifford Roberts... bought the nursery’s spread with plans to fashion a golf course from its landscape.

            <p>
                Immediately south, sandwiched between the Augusta Country Club and a campus of what is now Augusta University, lies Sand Hills, a Black neighborhood... where most of the caddies grew up. Close enough to the city’s seats of power that the residents could work in them, even if they could not walk through their front doors. Still, the community felt like “one big family,” recalls Jim Dent... But “the grandfather of caddies” came from even closer: Fruitland itself. Willie Lee Stokes was born in 1920 on a parcel of the property... When Augusta National opened, in 1932, Stokes became the personal caddie for Clifford Roberts, who dubbed him “Pappy.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Stokes’s roots on the land gave him an advantage—he knew how to read the fairways and greens better than others. Take Rae’s Creek... Stokes understood that every putt would break toward Rae’s, the pull of gravity sending balls toward the lowest point on the property.
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                “It wasn’t just carrying a bag. It was about knowing the nuances of the course, knowing the grain of the greens, and knowing when to talk and when to be silent. We were the interpreters of Augusta.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Augusta National first put on what would come to be called the Masters Tournament in 1934 with its rule in place—attributed to Roberts—that golfers would always be white, and the caddies would always be Black. The segregated course had support from the top: From that same year until 1961, the Professional Golfers’ Association of America had a “Caucasian-only” clause in its bylaws... Stokes decided to teach the Black youth in Sand Hills what he knew. Caddying, after all, could provide consistent income and food on the table, even if most chalked the job up as low-skill menial labor...
            </p>
            <p>
                Many in Sand Hills worked in one of the area cotton mills, bringing home a mere fifteen or so dollars a week for the hot, backbreaking job. A strong young boy, eager to please and willing to work rain or shine, could make more than that caddying. The kids could also earn around a dollar a day “shagging balls,” golf-speak for chasing balls hit from the practice tee.

            <p>
                The best caddies employ the properties and laws that govern space, time, energy, and matter—but using only their eyes and ears to assess equations that are always changing... That dynamic played out during the 1979 Masters, when **Jariah “Bubba” Beard** was on the bag for Fuzzy Zoeller. “He told me where to hit it, where not to hit it…it was like a blind man with a Seeing Eye dog. He led me around that golf course.” By relying on Beard, Zoeller became the last Masters player to win the tournament on his first try.
            </p>
            <p>
                “When I met Carl Jackson, I said, what a gift this is,” recalled Ben Crenshaw... Crenshaw’s 1976 pairing with Jackson... became a lifelong working relationship... The PGA players asked Augusta National’s chairman at the time, Hord Hardin, to lift the ban on outside caddies. Hardin, at last, complied. The next year, only eighteen of the tournament’s eighty-two players used Augusta National’s Black caddies... “Money,” Robert Jones says, “changed the world.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Black faces on the greens, too, have all but disappeared. “We only have two Black people on the PGA Tour right now,” Dent points out. “When I was out on tour, we had fourteen at one time.” That’s the irony of the Masters’ all-Black-caddie rule: It was archaic and steeped in racism. And it also, the men admit, granted them entry to a gilded world where they had a chance to learn the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                The small Lucy Craft Laney Museum of Black History and Conference Center... has also played a mighty part in recognizing the caddies... Six-foot-tall banners bearing photographs of caddies in their element, or in a moment of victory, frame the room. Here they get to live large... But that legacy isn’t limited to the past... **André Lacey II**, Jim Dent’s grandson, is now an assistant men’s and women’s golf coach at Paine College and runs a nonprofit... lowering the economic barrier to access.
            </p>
            <p>
                That week, some fifteen hundred private jets will fly into the city... André Lacey II will be mentoring local young people and teaching the fundamentals at his Nike Junior Golf Camp nearby. The camp will end at noon, and depending on what the sky looks like, Lacey might head to the Patch afterward, to the beloved clubhouse with its treasured card games. Perhaps he’ll even join the old caddies for a round.
